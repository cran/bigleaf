\description{
Bulk canopy maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax25), and maximum electron
             transport rate (Jmax25) at 25 degrees Celsius from bulk intercellular 
             CO2 concentration using the Farquhar et al. 1980 model for C3 photosynthesis.
}
\details{
The maximum carboxylation rate at 25degC (Vcmax25) and the maximum electron
         transport rate at 25degC (Jmax25), which characterize photosynthetic capacity,
         are calculated as at leaf level. 
         The required variables Gs and Ci can be calculated from 
         \code{\link{surface.conductance}} and \code{\link{intercellular.CO2}}, respectively.
         
         Gas exchange parameters are taken from Bernacchi et al. 2001 (apparent values, which
         assume an infinite mesophyll conductance). Negative and very low Ci values 
         (the threshold is set to Ci < 80umol mol-1 at the moment) are filtered out.
         
         Vcmax is calculated from the photosynthesis model by Farquhar et al. 1980.
         If net photosynthesis is Rubisco-limited (RuBP-saturated carboxylation
         rate, i.e. light has to be (near-)saturating):
        
           \deqn{Vcmax = (GPP * (Ci + Kc*(1.0 + Oi/Ko))) / (Ci - Gam)}
         
         where Kc and Ko are the Michaelis-Menten constants for CO2 and O2 (mmol mol-1),
         respectively, Oi is the O2 concentration, and Gam is the photorespiratory CO2
         compensation point (umol mol-1).
         Under low-light conditions, the electron transport rate J is calculated from
         the RuBP regeneration-limited photosynthesis rate:
         
           \deqn{J = (GPP * (4.0 * Ci + 8.0 * Gam) / (Ci - Gam)}
         
         In this function, bulk canopy photosynthesis is assumed to be Rubisco/RuBP-regeneration
         limited, if incoming PPFD is above/below a specified threshold or range. These ranges
         are determined by the parameters \code{PPFD_j} and \code{PPFD_c}. If, for example,
         \code{PPFD_j = c(100,400)}, all conditions with a PPFD between 100 and 400 are assumed
         to be in the RuBP-regeneration (i.e. light-limited) photosynthesis domain. The electron
         transport rate J is then only calculated for periods that meet this criterion.
         
         Jmax is calculated from J and absorbed irradiance:
         
           \deqn{J = (APPFD_PSII + Jmax - sqrt((APPFD_PSII + Jmax)^2 - 
                    4.0 * Theta * APPFD_PSII * Jmax)) / (2.0 * Theta)
                }
              
         where APPFD_PSII is the absorbed PPFD by photosystem II (PS II), 
         and Theta is a curvature parameter. APPFD_PSII is calculated as
         
           \deqn{PPFD * alpha_canopy * 0.85 * beta}
         
         where alpha_canopy is canopy-scale absorptance, 0.85 is a correction factor,
         and beta is the fraction of photons absorbed by PS II (assumed 0.5).
         alpha_canopy accounts for non-absorbing components of the ecosystem such as
         stems or soil, and is very likely ecosystem-specific. This parameter is relatively
         sensitive for the determination of Jmax25 at some sites.
         
         Vcmax and Jmax at canopy level are assumed to follow the same temperature response
         as at leaf level. Hence, the respective parameter k at 25degC (k25) is calculated as 
         (see e.g. Kattge & Knorr 2007):
         
           \deqn{k25 = k / 
                       ( exp(Ha * (Temp - Tref) / (Tref * Rgas * Temp)) *
                       (1 + exp((Tref * dS - Hd) / (Tref * Rgas))) /
                       (1 + exp((Temp * dS - Hd) / (Temp * Rgas)))
                       )
                 }
         
         where Ha is the activation energy (kJ mol-1), Hd is the deactivation energy (kJ mol-1),
         and dS is the entropy term (kJ mol-1 K-1) of the respective parameter. Tref is set
         to 298.15 K.
         
         For C4 photosynthesis, the simplified model by von Caemmerer 2000 is used.
         For light-saturated photosynthesis, Vcmax is given by:
         
           \deqn{Vcmax = GPP}
         
         Note that in addition to the range \code{PPFD_c}, the range \code{Ci_C4}
         discards all periods with low Ci, in which photosynthesis is likely to
         be CO2-limited (see von Caemmerer 2000 for details).
         
         In the light-limited case, J is calculated as:
         
           \deqn{J = 3 * GPPj / (1 - 0.5) }
         
         The calculation of Jmax25 and Vcmax25 is identical to C3 photosynthesis
         as described above.
}
\note{
The critical assumption is that bulk canopy photosynthesis is limited by
        one of the two limitation states. Incoming PPFD is assumed to determine
        the limitation states. Note however that the ranges (\code{PPFD_j} and \code{PPFD_c})
        are likely ecosystem-specific. E.g. dense canopies presumably require higher
        \code{PPFD_c} thresholds than open canopies. A threshold of 500 umol m-2 s-1 PPFD
        for Rubisco-limited photosynthesis was assumed a reasonable working assumption (see Kosugi et al. 2013).
        Here, \code{PPFD_c} defaults to 1000 umol m-2 s-1. Note that even under very high/low irradiances,
        not all photosynthetically active plant material of an ecosystem will be in the same
        limitation state. Note that parameters describing bulk canopy photosynthetic capacity are not directly 
        comparable to their leaf-level counterparts, as the former integrate over the entire canopy
        depth (i.e. are given per ground area, and not per leaf area).
        In general, the function should be used with care!
