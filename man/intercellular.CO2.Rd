\description{
Bulk canopy intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) calculated based on Fick's law
             given surface conductance (Gs), gross primary productivity (GPP) and 
             atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca).
}
\details{
Bulk intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) is given by:

           \deqn{Ci = Ca - (GPP - Rleaf)/(Gs/1.6)}
         
         where Gs/1.6 (mol m-2 s-1) represents the surface conductance to CO2.
         Note that Gs is required in mol m-2 s-1 for water vapor. Gs is converted to
         its value for CO2 internally.
         Ca can either be atmospheric CO2 concentration (as measured), or surface
         CO2 concentration as calculated from \code{\link{surface.CO2}}.
}
\note{
The equation is based on Fick's law of diffusion and is equivalent to the
      often used equation at leaf level (ci = ca - An/gs).
      Note that GPP and Gs have a different interpretation than An and gs.
      Gs comprises non-physiological contributions (i.e. physical evaporation)
      and is confounded by physical factors (e.g. energy balance non-closure).
      GPP does not account for dark respiration and is further subject to uncertainties
      in the NEE partitioning algorithm used. Leaf respiration can be provided,
      but it is usually not known at ecosystem level (as a consequence, Ci is likely to be 
      slightly underestimated)
      This function should be used with care and the resulting Ci might not be
      readily comparable to its leaf-level analogue and/or physiological meaningful.
